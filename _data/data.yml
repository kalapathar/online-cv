    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am currently an AI Consultant at Deloitte. I am getting a lot of exposure with wide ranges of clients and I help them design their AI Pipeline. Before Deloitte, I was a cyber security engineer at Sports Engine (owned by NBC Sports) where I designed a safe infrastructure to protect networking systems from potential hackers and cyber-attacks. 
      Before working at Sports Engine, I was a full stack developer at Kipsu in Minneapolis. 
      I graduated from St. Olaf with dual-degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
      Blockchain, Cryptography and Computer Networks are my top interests.

      I grew up in southern Nepal and studied at Budhanilkantha School. Having left home at an early age, 
      I had the opportunity to live with people who differ in terms of political views, financial status, religious views, 
      gender identities, citizenship status and a lot more. 
      My experiences have shaped me to become a kind & genuine mission-driven person and a developer.

        authors: Adam H. Berliner, Derek DeBlieck and Deepak Shah
        conference: In this paper, we discover all sign pattern matrices of order n that allow inertias in the Set S(n). All sign patterns of order 3 (up to equivalence) that allow S(3) are classified and organized according to their associated directed graphs.

        authors: Mazen Abusharkh, Syver Johansen, Deepak Shah, Elif Ilaria Yurtseven
        conference: This research paper proposes a voting system solution based on the blockchain. As a secured and transparent ledger, the blockchain introduces a potential solution to a decentralized vote validation and a distributed vote counting mechanism, such that the voters need not trust a third party to facilitate the democratic process. We also demonstrate a sample voting application that can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
