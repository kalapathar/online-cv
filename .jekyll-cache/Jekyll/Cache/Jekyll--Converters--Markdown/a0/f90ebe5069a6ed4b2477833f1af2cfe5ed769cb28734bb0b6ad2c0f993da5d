I"Î<p>I am currently an AI Consultant at Deloitte. I am getting a lot of exposure with wide ranges of clients and I help them design their AI Pipeline. Before Deloitte, I was a cyber security engineer at Sports Engine (owned by NBC Sports) where I designed a safe infrastructure to protect networking systems from potential hackers and cyber-attacks. 
Before working at Sports Engine, I was a full stack developer at Kipsu in Minneapolis. 
I graduated from St. Olaf with dual-degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
Blockchain, Cryptography and Computer Networks are my top interests.</p>

<p>I grew up in southern Nepal and studied at Budhanilkantha School. Having left home at an early age, 
I had the opportunity to live with people who differ in terms of political views, financial status, religious views, 
gender identities, citizenship status and a lot more. 
My experiences have shaped me to become a kind &amp; genuine mission-driven person and a developer.</p>
