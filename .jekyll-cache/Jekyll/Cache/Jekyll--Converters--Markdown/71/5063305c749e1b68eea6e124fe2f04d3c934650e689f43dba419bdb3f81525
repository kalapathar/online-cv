I"v<p>I got an opportunity to work with mindful, intelligent and humble software developers. Small team environments and pair programming were common. 
While I worked on a wide range of projects, I focused in the security area at Kipsu.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add functionalities on the web application built with Codeigniter, a PHP framework &amp; ActiveRecord + SQL</li>
  <li>Detect security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) on the application and fix them</li>
  <li>Configure ansible-playbooks to automate application deployment in AWS</li>
  <li>Write test plans, design documentations and practice Scrum, an agile framework</li>
</ul>
